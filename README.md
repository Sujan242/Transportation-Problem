# Vogel-s-Approximation-Method
This repo contains the variants of VOM .

Presently the proposed variants are: 
1. VOM
2. Maximum penalty per unit
3. Maximum penalty cost 
4. Maximum penalty per unit cost

All the above variants are applied on the following non-dimensional matrices
1. Cost matrix
2. Total oppurtunity matrix
3. Minimum matrix
4. Maximum matrix
5. Average matrix

In additional to the above variants the following have been implemented:
1. Maximum demand heuristic
2. Maximum supply heuristic
3. A few more simply tried out
Calculated the number of times each of these 19 variants gave better results in comparison to orignal Vogel Approximation Method(2008).


TODO:
1. Measure performance of each algorithm using EOS,ARPD,IRPD ...
2. Compare all results with solution obtained from LINGO set code
