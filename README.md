# Vogel-s-Approximation-Method
This repo contains solutions to the Transporation problem.

Presently the proposed variants are: 
1. VOM
2. Maximum penalty per unit
3. Maximum penalty cost 
4. Maximum penalty per unit cost

All the above variants are applied on the following non-dimensional matrices
1. Cost matrix
2. Total oppurtunity matrix
3. Minimum matrix
4. Maximum matrix
5. Average matrix

In additional to the above variants the following have been implemented:
1. Maximum demand heuristic
2. Maximum supply heuristic
3. Trans-Cost on TOM
4. Weighted Trans-Cost on TOM
5. Weighted per unit Trans-Cost on TOM
6. Standard deviation method (highly inefficient : could make it run way faster xD). 
7. TOCM-MT proposed in 2019(sciencedirect journal).
8. KSAM proposed in 2020(sciencedirect journal).
9. VAM with zero penalty avoided.
10. Russel Approximation method.
11. Geomtric mean method
12. Maximum row-column total penalty cost
13. JHM 
14. Weighted Penalty cost
15. I-VAM (2019 Babu et all).
16. A few more simply tried out.

Calculated the number of times each of these variants gave better results in comparison to orignal Vogel Approximation Method(2008).
Calculated integrated ranks for each of these algorithms.
Calculated deviation from optimal solution(obtained from LINGO set code).
