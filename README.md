# Vogel-s-Approximation-Method
This repo contains the variants of VOM .

Presently the proposed variants are: 
1. VOM
2. Maximum penalty per unit
3. Maximum penalty cost 
4. Maximum penalty per unit cost

All the above variants are applied on the following non-dimensional matrices
1. Cost matrix
2. Total oppurtunity matrix
3. Minimum matrix
4. Maximum matrix
5. Average matrix

Calculated the number of times each of these 19 variants gave better results in comparison to orignal Vogel Approximation Method(1958).


TODO:
1. Measure performance of each algorithm using EOS,ARPD,IRPD ...
